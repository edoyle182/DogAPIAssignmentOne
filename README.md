Create an app that lets users choose to display between 1 and 50 random dog images, then prints the results to the console. 

# Requirements:

- The input should default to 3. 
- Use the endpoint described in the "DISPLAY MULTIPLE RANDOM IMAGES FROM ALL DOGS COLLECTION" section of this page of the DogAPI docs.
